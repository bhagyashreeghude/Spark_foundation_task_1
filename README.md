## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of a supervised learning model in machine learning using Python. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data (input-output pairs) to make predictions or classify new, unseen data.

## Features

- Demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing a supervised learning model.
- Utilizes a popular machine learning library such as scikit-learn.
- Provides code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and update the necessary paths in the code.
2. Follow the prompts to train the model on your dataset.
3. View the model's performance metrics and predictions.

## Model

Provide an overview of the supervised learning model you're using. Explain the algorithm, its parameters, and any hyperparameter tuning.

## Evaluation

Discuss how the model's performance is evaluated. Mention the evaluation metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and interpret the results.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
